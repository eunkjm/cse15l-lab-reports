# **Lab Report 1 : Remote Access**

**Part 1 - Activate The CSE 15L account**

This lab requires a course-specific account for the remote access.
To find your CSE 15L account, go to [UCSD Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
and look for an account that starts with cs15ll.

In order to use this account, it needs to be activated by changing the password. (It could take up to 30 minutes for the passworde change to be applied.)
